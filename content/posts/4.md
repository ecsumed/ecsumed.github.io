Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) has two versions of the auth endpoint: `v1` and `v2`.

When using OAuth2, using the `v2` endpoint is important because the `audience` returned on the `v1` endpoint is static and does not match what we'd like to have, that is the `appid`. Also and more importantly, the `v1` endpoint **does not** return any roles attached to the user:
```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=$AZ_APP_ID&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default&client_secret=$AZ_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials" \
  "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$AZ_TENANT_ID/oauth2/token" -s |
    jq '.access_token' -r |
      jwt decode -

...
Token claims
------------
{
  ...
  "aud": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
  ...
  "ver": "1.0",
  ...
}
```

So we use the `v2` endpoint. Should be easy enough. Not exactly. Here's what the `v2` endpoint returns:
```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=$AZ_APP1_ID&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default&client_secret=$AZ_CLIENT1_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials" \
  "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$AZ_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token" -s |
    jq '.access_token' -r |
      jwt decode -

...
Token claims
------------
{
  ...
  "aud": "https://graph.microsoft.com",
  ...
  "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/<TENANT>/",
  ...
  "ver": "1.0",
  ...
}
```

We see that the `v2` endpoint responds with a `v1` response. This is problematic because the issuers are different for each endpoint. 

We can't use the `v2` `issuer` in the client application because, since the response is `v1`, the app will throw a mismatch error. We also can't use the `v1` issuer because there's also the `jwks` mismatch as well.

There's also the issue with roles. The `v1` endpoint does not return any roles.

Fortunately, the solution is simple.

According to the Entra ID docs, we need to configure `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` in the manifest of the Application Registration.
```json
    "accessTokenAcceptedVersion": 2,
```

But the `v2` endpoint still won't work. Turns out there's one more piece to this puzzle and thanks to this [answer from @Sridevi on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78338256), we know what it is.

In the Entra ID Application Registration we need to "expose an API" and use that as a scope for the token request.
```bash
curl \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=$AZ_APP_ID&scope=api%3A%2F%2F$AZ_APP_ID%2F.default&client_secret=$AZ_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials" \
  "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$AZ_TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token" -s  | 
    jq '.access_token' -r | 
      jwt decode -

...
{
  ...
  "aud": "<APP_ID>",
  ...
  "iss": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT>/v2.0",
  "roles": [
    ...
  ],
  ...
  "ver": "2.0"
}
```

There it is! The right `issuer`, `audience` and also the attached `roles`.
