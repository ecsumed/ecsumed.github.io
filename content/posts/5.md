Having worked with *nix for so long and seeing exit code `137` so often, somehow my brain started mapping `137` to `OOM (Out of Memory)` when, in fact, it's not.

Recently, while troubleshooting a failed pod, the container reported the following last state:
```yaml
    Last State:     Terminated
      Reason:       Error
      Exit Code:    137
```

Looking at monitoring graphs, it was evident the container was no where near its memory thresholds.

Any error code above `128` means `FATAL` and contains the error signal.

So, `137 -128 = 9`, and signal `9` is `SIGKILL`, which **_most of the time_** is caused by `OOM`, but not always.

Turns out the `SIGKILL` was caused by a `readinessProbe` failure, and the k8s events showed this:
```yaml
Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                     From     Message
  ----     ------     ----                    ----     -------
  Warning  Unhealthy  54m (x7 over 61m)       kubelet  (combined from similar events): Readiness probe failed: Get "<HEALTH_ENDPOINT>": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```

And Kubernetes does not mention this reason in the "Last State" attribute.

As of the time of writing this, there's an open issue to fix this.
